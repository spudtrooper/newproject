# newproject

Creates a skeleton go project using defaults for me.

# Install

```
go install github.com/spudtrooper/newproject
```

## Usage

From the directory to update:

```
~/go/bin/newproject
```

or you can point to another directory:

```
~/go/bin/newproject --name <PROJECT_NAME>
```

and you'll have a new project in `<PROJECT_NAME>`/
